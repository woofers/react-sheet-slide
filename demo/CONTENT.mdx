# react-sheet-slide

🏞️ 🎢 🛝 A responsive React draggable sheet and dialog component.

No more hard to use and dismiss modal experiences for mobile users.
Instead `react-sheet-slide` provides a fully draggable sheet
that properly blocks weird overscrolling and focus bugs.  Then on desktop
this component optionally supports a fully-featured modal.
Alterativly the sheet can be used on desktop as-well if so desired.

## Features

- Responsive way to display blocking modal-like content on mobile web-apps.
- Accessible with proper scroll & focus blocking, with `Esc` to close on desktop.
- Supports dark and light mode out of the box
- Customizable detents
- Similar API to Apple's UIKit sheet
- Supports Server-Side rendering.
- Built with css-modules (no styled-in-js library needed)

## Motivation

This library is largely based on the fantastic [react-spring-bottom-sheet](https://github.com/stipsan/react-spring-bottom-sheet).  While [react-spring-bottom-sheet](https://github.com/stipsan/react-spring-bottom-sheet) is much more feature-packed than `react-sheet-slide`, supporting more props like many different callbacks on sheet snap start/end.
However the extra dependencies like `xstate` and the `resize-observer` polyfill can lead to a larger bundle size.
Also using `react-spring` as a dependencies instead of a peer dependencies limits users of the library from
controlling the version of `react-spring` they use. It can also lead to 2 versions of `react-spring` being bundled,
if the user is using a newer or older major version than the library.

By simplifying the API these libraries can be removed, and by moving `react-spring` to a peer dependencies
makes the library have a much lighther footprint.  Also `react-sheet-slide` includes a
dark mode and a fully-featured desktop modal that can be enabled for non-mobile users.
It also adds support for a backdrop animation similar to Apple's UIKit.

## Installation

**Yarn**

```yarn
yarn add react-sheet-slide @react-spring/web@^9 @use-gesture/react@^10
```

**npm**

```npm
npm install react-sheet-slide @react-spring/web@^9 @use-gesture/react@^10
```

## Usage

<LiveCodeSample />

`react-sheet-slide` includes a `Portal` component however other portal can be used like
`@reach/portal` or `@mui/base`.  The one included is just of modified version of `@reach/portal` however with support for string refs and defaults to `body`.

`rss-backdrop` is required to apply the sheet backdrop effect.  Omitting this class will disable any backdrop styles on the sheet.
`react-sheet-slide` will also set a `body` background-color when the sheet is open to create the inset for the backdrop effect.
As such it is recommended to apply the background to a top level `div` or other container, in addition to the `body`.
If you want to keep your `body` background, use `!important`.

## Props

- <code>open</code>

  Set if the sheet is open.  When this prop is changed the sheet
  will animate and the unmount/remount.  When the component fully unmounts, `onClose` will be called.

- <code>onDismiss</code>

  Called when the sheet is dragged down or the user clicks on the backdrop.  Also called when the user presses `Esc`.
  This method should include `setOpen(false)` to ensure `open` is false.  Otherwise the sheet may not close properly.

- <code>onClose</code>

  Called when the sheet finishes the close animation and is fully unmounted.

- <code>selectedDetent</code>

  The default detent size that the sheet will open to.

- <code>detents</code>

  List of available detents that the sheet will catch on.  Reccomened to set to either `detents.large` or <code>{'props => [detents.large(props), detents.medium(props)]'}</code>
  to mimic the UIKit behaviour however can be customized using the callback.

- <Fieldset>
    <Legend>useDarkMode</Legend>
    <RadioGroup>
      <Radio value="auto" name="useDarkMode">Auto</Radio>
      <Radio value="off" name="useDarkMode">Light</Radio>
      <Radio value="on" name="useDarkMode">Dark</Radio>
    </RadioGroup>
  </Fieldset>
  Prop to control if dark mode is enabled.  By default this will use the system `prefers-color-scheme`.

- <Fieldset>
    <Legend>useModal</Legend>
    <RadioGroup>
      <Radio value="auto" name="useModal">Auto</Radio>
      <Radio value="off" name="useModal">Sheet</Radio>
      <Radio value="on" name="useModal">Modal</Radio>
    </RadioGroup>
  </Fieldset>
  Prop to control when a modal should be used instead of a sheet.  If your app will likely only be used on mobile `useModal={false}` is reccomened.
  Otherwise it will default to true on any device larger than `(max-width: 640px)` to use a modal on desktop.

- <Switch name="scrollingExpands">scrollingExpands</Switch>

  Determines if scrolling up on the sheet body will expand the sheet.  Once the sheet is expanded
  to the max detent, the sheet will be scrollable.  Disabled by default to provide a more predictable scroll behaviour
  however enabling it if possible is recommended.

- `ref`

  The sheet also supports forwarding a ref that will be added onto the sheet root.
